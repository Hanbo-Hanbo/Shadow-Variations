# Shadow Variations
## A Multi-Dimensional AI Exploration of Hand Shadow Datasets

### 1. Introduction
Shadow Variations is a multi-dimensional project that transcends the boundaries of art, sociology, and medicine by utilizing hand shadows as an abstract medium. The project showcases the technical potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in feature extraction while reflecting the speculative value of computational arts in addressing real-world issues, such as privacy-preserving healthcare monitoring.

### 2. Dataset Overview
This dataset is a collection of hand shadow images featuring three distinct categories: Bird, Dog, and Snake. 

- __Sourcing__: All materials were sourced from original, self-captured photography.
- __Diversity__: Gestures were recorded under controlled single-source lighting, encompassing diverse hand sizes and projection angles.
- __Specifications__: Images were unified, grayscaled, and resized to 128 x 128 pixels as tensors for optimal feature extraction.
- __Automation__: A custom Python automation script was implemented to organize the repository into a professional Dataset_Final directory architecture.
- __Partitioning__: The data is physically partitioned into a 70% Training, 20% Validation, and 10% Testing split to ensure an unbiased evaluation environment.

### 3. Methodology Summary
I developed this CNN model using the Keras Sequential API to validate real-time camera interactions and train the recognition engine:

- __Hierarchical Feature Extraction__: By implementing three convolutional layers, I achieved feature extraction ranging from basic edges to complex silhouettes.
- __Spatial Robustness__: The integration of pooling layers ensures spatial robustness, allowing for accurate recognition despite positional shifts.
- __Classification Logic__: Finally, the visual signals are converted into a probability distribution via the Softmax function, ensuring a rigorous and scientific classification.

$$P(y=i | x) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{3} e^{z_j}}$$

### 4. Creative Applications
The project explores three speculative approaches for AI application:

- __Approach 1: Creative Interactive System__: This project speculates on an interactive educational theater that utilizes real-time AI to transform traditional hand shadows into a multi-sensory experience. When the model Softmax confidence exceeds a 0.8 threshold, the silhouette comes to life with audio-visual feedback.
- __Approach 2: Critical Social Experiment__: While humans embrace ambiguity, the CNN is mathematically forced by its Softmax architecture to assign 100 percent probability across predefined classes. This inherent lack of doubt critiques the reductive nature of AI, which simplifies complex realities into forced certainties.
- __Approach 3: Healthcare Speculation__: This proposal utilizes hand shadow edge-blur to derive an objective Stability Index to quantify fine motor skills without specialized hardware. It offers a non-invasive, privacy-preserving solution for early screening of motor disorders like Parkinson's disease.

### 5. Project Structure
The repository is organized to maintain a clear separation between raw data and processing logic:
- shadow/: Contains original video files and raw images organized by category.
- Dataset_Final/: The partitioned dataset generated by automation scripts, ready for training.
- video_to_images.py: An OpenCV based engine for high-density frame extraction.
- split_data.py: A Python automation script for physical data partitioning and directory reconstruction.
- train_model.ipynb: The core training notebook featuring the CNN architecture and performance visualization.
